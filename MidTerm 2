2.1. Which packages are available for ML? Describe the pros and cons and document the availability.

There are several popular machine learning libraries available, including Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning. Scikit-learn is a great choice for beginners as it is easy to use and has excellent documentation. TensorFlow is powerful and great for building large, complex models, but has a steeper learning curve. Keras is easy to use and good for quickly building and testing neural network models, but may not offer enough control for advanced users. PyTorch is similar to TensorFlow but easier to use, and good for building complex models. Microsoft Azure Machine Learning is cloud-based and good for enterprise-level applications. The best choice depends on your specific needs and preferences. They are all widely available and can be easily downloaded and installed.


2.2. What is Chembl? How do you access it?

ChEMBL is a large publicly available database of bioactive molecules and their properties, with a focus on drug discovery research. It contains information on millions of compounds, including their structures, activities, and pharmacological properties. ChEMBL can be accessed through its website (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) or through its API (Application Programming Interface), which allows users to programmatically retrieve data from the database. The website provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for compounds, targets, or assays and download data in various formats.


2.3. What is machine learning, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that lets computers learn and improve from data, rather than following explicit instructions. We give the computer data and algorithms that learn patterns and relationships within that data to make predictions or decisions. There are three types of machine learning: supervised learning (training the computer on labeled data), unsupervised learning (training the computer on unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (training the computer through rewards and punishments). Traditional programming involves writing specific instructions for the computer to follow, while machine learning involves training the computer to learn and improve from data.


2.4. What are the key concepts and techniques in machine learning?

In machine learning, we use data preparation to collect, clean, and pre-process data before using it for training. Feature engineering helps select the most relevant features from the data to improve the accuracy of the model. In supervised learning, the computer is trained on labeled data to make predictions, while unsupervised learning involves identifying patterns in unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning is used when the computer learns through feedback in an environment. Model evaluation tests the accuracy and effectiveness of the machine learning model, while hyperparameter tuning selects optimal settings for the model. These are some of the key concepts and techniques used in machine learning.


2.5. What are the different types of machine learning algorithms?

Machine learning is when computers can learn by themselves without being specifically programmed for a task. It is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that data.
There are different types of machine learning, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, transfer learning, and ensemble learning. Each type of machine learning has its own strengths and weaknesses, and they are used for different types of problems.
In supervised learning, the computer is trained with labeled data, which means the data has known outcomes. In unsupervised learning, the computer is given unlabeled data and must find patterns or relationships within the data. In reinforcement learning, the computer learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments.
Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn representations of data. Transfer learning involves taking a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it for a new task, and ensemble learning combines multiple models to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Overall, machine learning is a powerful tool for solving complex problems, and choosing the right type of machine learning for the task at hand is crucial for success.

2.6. What are the common applications of machine learning?


Machine learning has a wide range of applications in various fields. Here are some common applications of machine learning:
Image and speech recognition: Machine learning is used to train models that can identify objects in images and recognize speech in audio recordings. This is used in a variety of applications, including virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, as well as in self-driving cars.
Fraud detection: Machine learning can be used to detect fraudulent transactions or activities by analyzing patterns in data.
Recommendation systems: Machine learning is used to create personalized recommendations for users based on their past behavior, such as recommending movies or products.
Natural language processing: Machine learning is used to analyze and understand human language, such as in chatbots, language translation, and sentiment analysis.
Predictive maintenance: Machine learning is used to predict when equipment or machinery is likely to fail, allowing for preventative maintenance to be performed before a breakdown occurs.
Financial modeling: Machine learning is used to analyze financial data and make predictions about stock prices, credit risk, and other financial metrics.
Healthcare: Machine learning is used to analyze medical images, diagnose diseases, and predict patient outcomes.
Autonomous vehicles: Machine learning is used to train models that can recognize and respond to objects in the environment, allowing for safe and efficient navigation of autonomous vehicles.


2.7. How do you evaluate the performance of a machine learning model?

Evaluating the performance of a machine learning model is crucial to ensure that it is accurate and effective. The performance evaluation methods used depend on the type of problem and the type of model being used. Here are some commonly used methods:
One common approach is to split the data into training and testing sets. The model is trained on the training set and then tested on the testing set to evaluate its performance. Another method is cross-validation, where the data is split into k-folds, and the model is trained and tested k times, with each fold used for testing in turn.
For classification problems, a confusion matrix can be used to evaluate the performance of a model. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Other metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score can also be used to evaluate classification models.
For binary classification problems, the ROC curve is often used to evaluate the performance of the model. The ROC curve is a plot of the true positive rate against the false positive rate for different classification thresholds.


2.8. How do you prepare data for use in a machine learning model?

To prepare data for a machine learning model, these common steps are often used:

Cleaning the data: Handling missing data, removing duplicates, and fixing other issues with the data.
Transforming the data: Converting categorical variables to numerical variables, scaling features, and normalizing the data.
Selecting relevant features: Choosing the most important features for the model and removing irrelevant ones.
Splitting the data: Separating the data into training and testing sets, and sometimes a validation set.
Augmenting the data: Creating new data through transformations like rotation or zooming.
Addressing imbalanced data: Dealing with datasets where one class has many more or fewer examples than others.
Handling outliers: Identifying and fixing outliers in the data that can affect the model's performance.


2.9. What are some common challenges in machine learning, and how can they be addressed?

Machine learning can be challenging and there are several common issues that can arise. Some of these include overfitting, underfitting, poor data quality, imbalanced data, interpretability, scaling, and computational resources. Techniques such as regularization, data cleaning, resampling, feature importance analysis, distributed computing, and cloud-based solutions can be used to address these challenges. It is important to carefully evaluate the specific problem and data to identify and address any challenges that may arise during the machine learning process.
