3.1. What is in the training set, how big is it?

The training Set is a part of the actual dataset (used to train the model). in this case its 70% from nearly 180'000 datapoints (so about 125000)


3.2. What modifications do you need to do to the data set to perform the tutorial.

the dataset we use does not have the pIC50 value calculated. we first have to calculate it from the IC50 value.


3.3. What is a test set? Any other types of set?

the test set is 30% from out dataset. is used to evaluate the performance of the trained Model


3.4. Before starting describe with 1-2 sentences, in your own words, what is done in each
of the cells.
written in the code/Notebook
