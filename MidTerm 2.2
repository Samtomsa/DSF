ChEMBL is a database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties, including information on their binding properties towards protein targets. It is maintained and developed by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). ChEMBL is a valuable resource for drug discovery and development, as well as for understanding the interactions between molecules and their targets.

To access ChEMBL, you can go to the ChEMBL website (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) and use the search bar to look for specific compounds, targets, or assays. The website provides detailed information on each compound, including its chemical structure, biological activity, and associated data such as assays, targets, and references. ChEMBL also offers a range of tools and resources for data mining and analysis, such as web services, data downloads, and programming interfaces.
