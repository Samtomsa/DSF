Greetings human!

Welcome to my GitHub.

Before you dive into the madness, let me give you a few pointers:

This repository is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're going to get.

If you find any bugs, don't be afraid to let me know. I promise I won't bite (unless you're made of chocolate).

On this repository you will find some codes and text from the SDF class im taking at UniBe.

So there you have it - my funny little READ ME for GitHub. Now go forth and explore, and don't forget to have a laugh or two along the way. Cheers!
