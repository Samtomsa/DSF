# Welcome to my GitHub Repository

Greetings human! I'm thrilled to have you here.

Before you start exploring, here are a few things you should know:

- This repository is a collection of various codes and text from the SDF class I'm currently taking at UniBe. It's like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're going to get.

- If you happen to find any bugs or issues, please let me know. I assure you, I won't bite (unless you're made of chocolate).

So, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and have some fun exploring this repository. And don't forget to have a good laugh or two along the way. Cheers!
