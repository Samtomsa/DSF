Greetings human!

Welcome to my humble abode on GitHub.

Before you dive into the madness, let me give you a few pointers:

This repository is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're going to get.

If you find any bugs, don't be afraid to let me know. I promise I won't bite (unless you're made of chocolate).

If you're looking for world-changing, cutting-edge technology, you're in the wrong place. My code is more like a rusty old bicycle than a shiny new Tesla. But hey, it gets the job done (sometimes).

Lastly, if you're wondering why I've decided to share my mediocre code with the world, the answer is simple: I'm a student.

So there you have it - my funny little READ ME for GitHub. Now go forth and explore, and don't forget to have a laugh or two along the way. Cheers!
